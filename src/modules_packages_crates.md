# Modules, Packages, Crates

In this section, we describe the package, crate and module system. As mentioned in the introduction, this will largely follow the design choice chosen by Rust, as such, it may be helpful to be familiar with [Rust's system](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html).
