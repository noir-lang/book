# TypeScript

Interactions with Noir programs can also be performed in TypeScript, which can come in handy when writing tests or when working in TypeScript-based projects like [Hardhat].

The following sections use the [_Standard Noir Example_] as an example to dissect a typical Noir workflow in TypeScript, with specific focus on its:

- Test script [`1_mul.ts`]
- Noir program [`main.nr`]
- Verifier contract generator script [`generate_sol_verifier.ts`]

You are also welcome to revisit the full scripts [`1_mul.ts`] of _Standard Noir Example_ and [`mm.ts`] of _Mastermind in Noir_ anytime for inspirations.

## Setup

Install [Yarn] and [Node.js].

Install Noir dependencies in your project by running:

```bash
$ yarn add @noir-lang/noir_wasm @noir-lang/barretenberg @noir-lang/aztec_backend
```

And import the applicable functions into your TypeScript file by adding:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
import { compile, acir_read_bytes } from '@noir-lang/noir_wasm';
import { setup_generic_prover_and_verifier, create_proof, verify_proof, create_proof_with_witness } from '@noir-lang/barretenberg/dest/client_proofs';
import { packed_witness_to_witness, serialise_public_inputs, compute_witnesses } from '@noir-lang/aztec_backend';
```

## Compiling

To begin proving and verifying a Noir program, it first needs to be compiled by calling `noir_wasm`'s `compile` function:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
const compiled_program = compile(path.resolve(__dirname, "../circuits/src/main.nr"));
```

The `compiled_program` returned by the function contains the [ACIR](../acir.md) and the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of your Noir program. They shall be stored for proving your program later:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
let acir = compiled_program.circuit;
const abi = compiled_program.abi;
```

> **Note:** Compiling with `noir_wasm` may lack some of the newer features that `nargo compile` offers. See the [Proving and Verifying Externally Compiled Files](#proving-and-verifying-externally-compiled-files) section to learn more.

## Specifying Inputs

Having obtained the compiled program, the program inputs shall then be specified in its ABI.

_Standard Noir Example_ is a program that multiplies input `x` with input `y` and returns the result:

```noir
# main.nr
fn main(x: u32, y: pub u32) -> pub u32 {
    let z = x * y;
    z
}
```

Hence, one valid scenario for proving could be `x = 3`, `y = 4` and `return = 12`:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
abi.x = 3;
abi.y = 4;
abi.return = 12;
```

> **Info:** Return values are also required to be specified, as they are merely syntax sugar of inputs with equality constraints.

> **Tip:** To best protect the private inputs in your program (if applicable) from public knowledge, you should consider minimizing any passing around of inputs and deleting the inputs on the prover instance once the proof is created when designing your program.

## Initializing Prover & Verifier

Prior to proving and verifying, the prover and verifier have to first be initialized by calling `barretenberg`'s `setup_generic_prover_and_verifier` with your Noir program's ACIR:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
let [prover, verifier] = await setup_generic_prover_and_verifier(acir);
```

## Proving

The Noir program can then be executed and proved by calling `barretenberg`'s `create_proof` function:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
const proof = await create_proof(prover, acir, abi);
```

## Verifying

The `proof` obtained can be verified by calling `barretenberg`'s `verify_proof` function:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
const verified = await verify_proof(verifier, proof);
```

The function should return `true` if the entire process is working as intended, which can be asserted if you are writing a test script:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts
expect(verified).eq(true);
```

## Verifying with Smart Contract

Alternatively, a verifier smart contract can be generated and used for verifying Noir proofs in TypeScript as well.

This could be useful if the Noir program is designed to be decentrally verified and/or make use of decentralized states and logics that is handled at the smart contract level.

To generate the verifier smart contract:

```ts
// generate_sol_verifier.ts

// Imports
import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';

...

// Generate verifier contract
const sc = verifier.SmartContract();
syncWriteFile("../contracts/plonk_vk.sol", sc);

...

function syncWriteFile(filename: string, data: any) {
    writeFileSync(join(__dirname, filename), data, {
      flag: 'w',
    });
}
```

To verify a Noir proof using the verifier contract:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts

// Imports
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { Contract, ContractFactory, utils } from 'ethers';

...

// Deploy verifier contract
let Verifier: ContractFactory;
let verifierContract: Contract;

before(async () => {
    Verifier = await ethers.getContractFactory("TurboVerifier");
    verifierContract = await Verifier.deploy();
});

...

// Verify proof
const sc_verified = await verifierContract.verify(proof);
expect(sc_verified).eq(true)
```

## Proving and Verifying Externally Compiled Files

In some cases, `noir_wasm` may lack some of the newer features for compiling Noir programs due to separated upgrade workflows.

To benefit from the best of both worlds, a Noir program can be compiled with `nargo compile`, with the `.acir` and `.tr` files then passed into your TypeScript project for proving and verifying:

```ts
// 1_mul.ts

// Parse acir
let acirByteArray = path_to_uint8array(path.resolve(__dirname, '../circuits/build/p.acir'));
let acir = acir_read_bytes(acirByteArray);

// Parse witness
let witnessByteArray = path_to_uint8array(path.resolve(__dirname, '../circuits/build/p.tr'));
const barretenberg_witness_arr = await packed_witness_to_witness(acir, witnessByteArray);

...

// Create proof
const proof = await create_proof_with_witness(prover, barretenberg_witness_arr);
```

> **Info:** The `.acir` file is the ACIR of your Noir program, and the `.tr` file is the witness file. The witness file can be considered as program inputs parsed for your program's ACIR.

See the [Commands] section to learn more about the `nargo compile` command.
